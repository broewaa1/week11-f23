Hmm, in this area, I'd like to say that I possess a strong foundation in transcriptional regulation through various mechanisms such as epigenetic regulation, understanding the role of transcription factors, and familiarity with HMG Box Domain proteins, lncRNAs, miRNAs, and RNA interference techniques, including CRISPR/Cas9.

In this module, I will be enhancing my comprehension of transcriptional regulation as I aim to delve into specific targets that have been extensively studied. This knowledge will guide me in identifying potential novel targets for CRISPR/Cas9 or similar technologies, which is highly relevant given my interest in genomic assemblies and CRISPR Cas9 targeting efficiency.

To measure the success of this module, I plan to expand my understanding of potential research targets, enabling me to pinpoint future research directions or identify critical factors when engaging in projects that involve perturbations in transcriptional regulation systems.

For progress, it'll be beneficial to keep abreast of the latest findings in the field, especially the ones related to structural variants flanked by genes of interest. I might also want to explore databases and repositories that detail CRISPR/Cas9 targets and outcomes of various genome-editing projects. By the end of this module, if I have a clear list of targets and a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in selecting them for CRISPR/Cas9 interventions, I will be well-positioned for future research endeavors.
