Broad Answers that are not refined.

M1. Microtubules are composed of α- and β-tubulin subunits that assemble into protofilaments, with 13 protofilaments forming the wall of the hollow microtubule structure. They display polarity with distinct (+) and (-) ends.

M2. Microtubules assemble from microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) like the centrosome. Tubulin dimers add preferentially to the (+) end. Microtubule dynamics involve phases of growth and rapid shortening due to gaining or losing a GTP cap.

M3. Important microtubule structures include cilia, flagella, the mitotic spindle, and axonal microtubules. Cilia use microtubule sliding for motility; flagella propel cells; the mitotic spindle segregates chromosomes; axonal microtubules transport organelles.

M4. Kinesins move toward the (+) end of microtubules, transporting organelles. Dyneins move toward the (-) end and also transport cargo when working with dynactin. Different kinesins have distinct cellular roles.

M5. Intermediate filaments provide structural integrity to cells and tissues. There are multiple classes: keratins in epithelia, desmin in muscle, neurofilaments in neurons, and nuclear lamins. Mutations cause diseases.

M6. The three cytoskeletal systems interact, for example in intracellular transport and cell migration. Microtubules and actin work together in growth cones. Cdc42 coordinates actin and microtubules during cell polarity.

M7. Experimental techniques to study microtubules and intermediate filaments include immunofluorescence, FRAP, isolation of microtubule motors, and analysis of mutants.

To summarize, knowledge of the cytoskeleton is important for careers in biotechnology and bioinformatics because these proteins carry out fundamental processes in cells and underlie the basis for many human diseases.
